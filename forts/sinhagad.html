    Sinhagad is a fortress located roughly 30 kilometers southwest of the city of Pune, India.
    Previously called Kondhana the fort has been the site of many important battles, most notably
    the Battle of Sinhagad in 1671. It was also strategically located at the centre of a string of other
    forts such as Rajgad, Purandar and Torna.Perched on an isolated cliff of the Bhuleswar range
    of the Sahyadri Mountains, it is situated on a hill rising 700 metres above sea level. Given natural
    protection by its very steep slopes, the walls and bastions were constructed at only key places;
    it has two gates – the KalyanDarwaza in the south-east and the Pune Darwaza in the north-east.

    This fort has had quite a long history; it was called 'Kondana' after the sage Kaundinya.
    The Kaundinyeshwar temple, the caves and the carvings indicate that this fort had probably
    been built two thousand years back. It was captured from the Koli tribal chieftain, Nag Naik,
    by Muhammad bin Tughlaq in 1328 AD.ShahajiBhosale, as the commander of Ibrahim Adil
    Shah I, was entrusted with the control of the Pune region. His son Shivaji, however, refused
    to accept the Adilshahi and initiated the task of setting up Swarajya. He gained control of
    Kondana in 1647 by convincing Siddi Amber, the AdilshahiSardar who controlled the fort.
    BapujiMudgalDeshpande played key role in this activity. In 1649, it had to be handed over to
    Adil Shah for ShahajiMaharaj's release. ShivajiMaharaj recaptured it back in 1656 again with the
    help of BapujiMudgalDeshpande,who convinced Fort commander by giving land in newly created
    Shivapur village and peacefully gained control of fort. This fort saw attacks by Mughals in 1662,
    1663 and 1665. In 1664, Shahistekhan, the Mughal general, even tried to bribe people of fort to hand
    over the fort to him but he was unsuccessful. Through the Treaty of Purandar, it passed into the hands
    of the Mughal army chief MirzarajeJaysingh, in the year 1665. In 1670, ShivajiMaharaj re-conquered this
    fort and then it stayed under Maratha rule till 1689. After the death of Sambhaji, the Mughals regained
    control f the fort. The Marathas, headed by SardarBalkawade, recaptured it in 1693. ChatrapatiRajaram
    took asylum on this fort during Mogul raid on Satara but Rajaram died on Sinhagad on the 3rd of March
    1700 & in 1703 Aurangzeb conquered the fort. In 1706, it once again went into the hands of the Marathas.
    PantajiShivdev of Sangola, VisajiChafar and the Pant Pratinidhis played key role in this battle. Then this
    fort remained with Marathas till 1818, when the British conquered it. British however took three months to
    capture this fort, which was longest it took them to win any fort in Maharashtra.
