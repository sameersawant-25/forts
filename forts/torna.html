    Torna Fort also known as Prachandagad is a large fort located in Pune district in the state of Maharashtra, India. It is historically
    significant because it is the first fort captured by Shivaji Maharaj in 1643, at the age of 16 forming the nucleus of the Maratha
    empire. The hill has an elevation of 1,403 metres (4,603 ft) above sea level, making it the highest hill-fort in the district. The name
    derives from Prachanda (Marathi for huge or massive) and gad (Marathi for fort).

    This fort is believed to have been constructed by the Shaiva Panth, followers of the Hindu god Shiva, in the 13th century. A
    Menghai Devi temple, also referred to as the Tornaji temple, is situated near the entrance of the fort.
    In 1643, Shivaji Maharaj captured this fort at the age of sixteen, thus making it one of the first forts that would become the
    Maratha empire. Shivaji renamed the fort ' 'Prachandagad' ' as Torna, and constructed several monuments and towers within it.
    In the 18th century, the Mughal empire briefly gained control of this fort after assassination of Shivaji Maharaj's son Sambhaji.
    Aurangzeb, then Mughal emperor, renamed this fort Futulgaib in recognition of the difficult defense the Mughals had to
    overcome to capture this fort. It was restored to the Maratha confederacy by the Treaty of Purandar.
