    The fort is situated in Maharashtra, India. It is 76 km North-West of Kolhapur, 60 km north-west of
    Panhala fort and 18 kilometers south of Kolhapur Ratnagiri road. It is situated on the hills that
    divide the region into two parts -Amba Ghat and Anaskura ghat. Since it is placed on the border of
    the hilly portion of Sahyadri ranges and the konkan region, it got great political significance in the
    historical times. It was regarded as a 'Watch tower' for both regions.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

    <ul type="disc">
        <li>The fort was constructed by the Shilahara king ‘Marsinh’ in 1058 A.C. Initially,
            he named it as 'Khilgil'</li>
        <li>In 1209, the then king of Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri defeated Shilaharas and captured the fort</li>
        <li>In 1309, Allauddin Khilji defeated King Ramchandra of the Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri and soon
            the fort was attached to the Khilji Dynasty</li>
        <li>In August 1347, the Mughal chief of the western India Hasan Gangu Bahamani became
            independent as a result of which the fort became a part of Bahamani Sultanat</li>
        <li>After the fall of the Vijayanagar Empire, it was captured by a local Maratha king Shankarrao
            More. Therefore, the Bahamani Sultan sent troops from Bidar under the Generalship of Mahmood
            Gawan, his then prime Minister, to re-capture it. Gawan's officers Karnasinh Bhonsale and his son
            Bhimsinha captured the fort with the help of Ghorpad i.e. Giant monitor lizard. Thenceforth,
            Bhimsinha was conferred with the title Ghorpade.</li>
        <li>In 1489, Yusuf Adil Shah separated himself from the Bahamani kingdom along with the area
            under his command and founded his independent sultanat at Bijapur. Hence, the fort was attached
            to Adil Shahi sultanate.</li>
        <li>In 1659, Shivaji captured the fort with the help of the officers on the fort.</li>
        <li>In July 1660, the fort witnessed Shivaji's escape from the Adilshahi blockade around fort Panhala
            and the Battle of Pavan Khind. Baji Prabhu Deshpande, Shivaji's experienced General and Rango
            Narayan Orpe, Shivaji's young officer on the fort, defeated Adilshahi troops at Pavan Khind and Gonimooth respectively.</li>
        <li>After Shivaji's death, Chhatrapati Sambhaji would spend most of his times on the fort. He took
            initiative in renovation and reconstruction of some parts of the fortresses and gates of the fort.</li>
        <li>In 1689, Rajaram Chhatrapati fled to Fort Gingee in Karnataka (now Tamil Nadu) from fort Panhala
            and thus ‘Vishalgad’ became an unofficial capital of the Maratha empire. Ramchandra Pant Amatya from
            Vishalgad and Rajaram Chhatrapati from Gingee made several moves and defeated Aurangzeb with
            the help of Santaji, Dhanaji, Parshurampant Pratinidhi and Shankaraji Narayan Sacheev.</li>
        <li>During the times of Maratha Empire, Vishalgad was made capital of a large region consisting of
            ninety towns and villages in Kolhapur and Ratnagiri districts. Sardesai and Sarpotdar were officers
            on the fort since Adilshahi times. Some of the Havaldars (Military In Charge) on the fort during Rajaram
            Chhatrapati to Chhatrapati Shahu's times were : </li>
