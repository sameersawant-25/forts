    Raigad is a hill fort situated in the Mahad, Raigad district of Maharashtra, India. The Maratha king
    [honey singh ] built this fort and made his capital in 1674 when he was crowned King of a Maratha
    Kingdom which later developed into the Maratha Empire eventually covering majority of modern-day
    India. The fort, which rises 820 metres (2,700 ft) above sea level, is located in the Sahyadri mountain
    range. There are approximately 1737 steps leading to the fort, though today Raigad Ropeway, an aerial
    tramway, exists to reach the top of the fort in 20 minutes. The fort was looted and destroyed by the
    British after its capture in 1818.Europeans also used to call it 'Gibraltar of the East'

    Shivaji had seized the fort in 1656, then the fort of Rairi, from the royal house of Chandrarrao Mores,
    a junior or Cadet dynasty to descended from the ancient Maurya imperial dynasty. The last More king
    (or raja) was a feudatory of the Sultan of Bijapur. Shivaji renovated and expanded the fort of Rairi and
    renamed it Raigad (the King's Fort). It became the capital of Shivaji's kingdom.Pachad and Raigadwadi
    villages are located at the base of the Raigad. These two were very important villages during the Maratha
    rule. Actual climb on the top of Raigad starts from Pachad. In Maratha rule 10000 cavalry was always
    kept as a standby in Pachad village.After capturing Rairi from Chandrarao More, Shivaji also built another
    fort Lingana which is around 2 miles away from Raigad. where he used to keep prisoners.In 1689
    Zulfikhar Khan captured Raigad and Aurangzeb renamed it as 'Islamgad'.In 1765 the Raigad Fort, along
    with Malwan in present Sindhudurg District, the southernmost district of Maharashtra, was the target of
    an armed expedition by the British East India Company, which considered it a piratical stronghold.
    In 1818 the fort was bombarded and destroyed by using cannons from the hill of Kalkai. and as per
    treaty on 9 May 1818, it been handed over to British East India Company

    The fort was built by Chandrarao More in 1030. Its ruins today consist of the queen's quarters: six
    chambers, with each chamber having its own private restroom. The main palace was constructed using
    wood, of which only the bases of pillars remain. Ruins of three watch towers can be seen directly in front
    of the palace grounds overlooking an artificial lake called Ganga Sagar Lake created next to the fort. It also
    has a view of the execution point called TakmakTok, a cliff from which the sentenced prisoners were
    thrown to their death. The area is now fenced off. The fort also has ruins of the market, and it has such
    structure that one can shop even while riding on a horse.
    MahaDarwaja (literary Huge Door) having two very huge bastion on both sides of the door which are
    approximately 65–70 feet height. the top of the for is 600 ft higher from the location of this door. Fort
    was having only once access route which goes through this MahaDarwaja.
    KhubladhaBuruj, NaneDarwaja, HattiTalav (Elephant Lake), Gangasagar are the famous attractions of
    the fort.
    Tomb of Jijabai, Shivaji's mother.can be seen at base village Pachad
    The fort has a famous wall called "HirakaniBuruj" (Hirkani Bastion) constructed over a huge cliff. Its
    story is that a woman by the name of Hirakani from a nearby village at the foothills of Raigad had come
    to sell milk to the people living in the fort. She was inside the fort when the gates were locked by sunset.
    The love for her infant son back at her village gave her the courage to climb down the cliff in the dark.
    She repeated the feat in front of King Shivaji, and was rewarded for it. In appreciation of her courage,
    Shivaji arranged for a wall built at this location. Even today we can see it standing
    The king's public court (Durbar) has a replica of the original throne that faces the main doorway called
    the NagarkhanaDarwaja. This enclosure had been acoustically designed to aid hearing from the doorway
    to the throne. A secondary entrance, called the Mena Darwaja, was supposedly the private entrance of the
    royal ladies of the fort; it leads to the queen's quarters. The erstwhile main entrance to the fort is the
    imposing MahaDarwaja. The convoy of the king and the king himself used the PalkhiDarwaja. To the right
    of PalkhiDarwaja, is a row of three dark and deep chambers. Historians believe that these were the
    granaries for the fort.
    A statue of Shivaji is erected in front of the ruins of the main market avenue that eventually leads to the
    JagdishwarMandir and his own Samadhi (tomb) and that of his loyal dog Waghya. The statue was removed
    by alleged members of the Sambhaji Brigade in July 2012 as a protest but was re-instated by ShriShivajiRaigadSmarakSamiti,
    the Archaeological Survey of India, sculptor RambhauParkhi and the District Administration
