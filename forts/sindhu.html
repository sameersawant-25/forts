    Sindhudurg Fort is a fort that occupies an islet in the Arabian Sea, just off the coast of Maharashtra in
    Western India. The fortress lies on the shore of Malvan town of Sindhudurg District in the Konkan region
    of Maharashtra, 450 kilometres (280 mi) south of Mumbai. It is a protected monument.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

        </b></h2>
    This fort was constructed by ShriChhatrapatiShivajiMaharaj, the Chhatrapati of the Maratha Empire.
    The construction was done under the supervision of HirojiIndulkar, in the year 1656.

        </b></h2>
    Over 4000 mounds of iron were used in the casting and foundation stones were firmly laid down. Construction started
    on 25 November 1664. Built over a period of three years (1664–67), the sea fort is spread over 48 acres (190,000 m2)
    with a two-mile (3 km) long rampart, and walls that are 30 feet (9.1 m) high and 12 feet (3.7 m) thick. The massive walls
    were designed to serve as a deterrent to approaching enemies and to the waves and tides of the Arabian Sea. The main
    entrance is concealed in such a way that no one can pinpoint it from outside.
    At a time when SamudraGaman (travelling by sea) was banned by scriptures, this construction on an island represents the
    revolutionary mindset of its engineer. A remain of an iron mould can be seen on the fort.

            <font color="maroon">Permanent residents</font>
        </b></h2>
    The number of permanent residents staying in the fort has been in decline since the fort's abandonment. Most of the
    residents moved out because of inadequate employment opportunities, but over 15 families remain in the fort. The
    SakpalNaik family (the original 'killedars') still resides in one of the 16 houses in the fort. However, DrSarangKulkarni's
    underwater discoveries have led to the establishment of the Indian sub-continent's only well-established scuba-diving
    industry. This has provided the local residents with some employment. Sindhudurgfort is a popular summer destination for
    Indian and foreign tourists to explore the island and go scuba-diving and snorkelling to view the coral reef on the outskirts of
    the island.
